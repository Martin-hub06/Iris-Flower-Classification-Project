# 🌼 Iris Flower Classification – AI/ML Internship Project (Week 1)

This project was completed as part of my *AI & ML Internship with NSP NEXUS*.  
It involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flower species based on four key features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

---

## 🔍 One-Line Description

A Python-based classification model built in Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab that predicts the species of an iris flower using petal and sepal measurements.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow using the Iris dataset.  
It includes model training, evaluation, and visualization, using:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand supervised classification using ML  
- Explore and visualize datasets using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib  
- Train models using scikit-learn  
- Evaluate results with confusion matrix and classification report  
- Compare model performance between KNN and Decision Tree  

---
